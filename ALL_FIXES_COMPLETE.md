# All Issues Fixed - Complete Summary

## Date: October 19, 2025

## 🎉 ALL ISSUES RESOLVED!

### ✅ 1. Apply Button Redirect Fixed
**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE**
**File**: `components/apply-button.tsx` (Line 108)

**Problem**: After applying for a job, users were redirected to `/(dashboard)/volunteer/applications` which doesn't exist.

**Solution**: Changed redirect to `/volunteer/applications`

```typescript
// Before (WRONG):
router.push("/(dashboard)/volunteer/applications")

// After (CORRECT):
router.push("/volunteer/applications")
```

**Result**: Users now correctly redirected to their applications page after applying.

### ✅ 2. Sign Out Button in Mobile Navbar
**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE**
**File**: `components/universal-navbar.tsx` (Lines 268-280)

**Problem**: Authenticated users on mobile had no way to sign out from the mobile drawer menu.

**Solution**: Added conditional rendering to show sign-out button for authenticated users.

```typescript
// Before:
{!isAuthenticated && (
  <div className="grid grid-cols-2 gap-3 pt-4 border-t">
    {/* Sign up / Sign in buttons */}
  </div>
)}

// After:
{!isAuthenticated ? (
  <div className="grid grid-cols-2 gap-3 pt-4 border-t">
    {/* Sign up / Sign in buttons */}
  </div>
) : (
  <div className="pt-4 border-t">
    <SignOut />
  </div>
)}
```

**Result**: Authenticated users can now easily sign out from mobile.

### ✅ 3. NGO Profile Jobs Count Display
**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE**
**File**: `app/ngos/[id]/page.tsx`

**Problem**: NGO profile page wasn't showing how many jobs the organization has posted.

**Solution**: Added a prominent stats section with 4 key metrics:

1. **Active Jobs** - Shows total active job postings
2. **Team Size** - Shows organization size
3. **Focus Areas** - Number of focus areas
4. **Verified Status** - Visual verification badge

**Implementation**:
```typescript
{/* Stats Section */}
<div className="border-b bg-card/50 backdrop-blur-sm">
  <div className="container mx-auto px-4 py-6 max-w-6xl">
    <div className="grid grid-cols-2 md:grid-cols-4 gap-4">
      {/* 4 stat cards with icons and numbers */}
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

**Features**:
- ✅ Responsive grid (2 cols on mobile, 4 on desktop)

**Result**: Users can immediately see organization statistics at a glance.
