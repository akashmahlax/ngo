# Job Posting Issues Fixed ‚úÖ

## Issues Resolved

### 1. ‚úÖ Limited Array Additions Fixed
**Problem:** Couldn't add more than one perk, or more than 3 requirements because of duplicate checking

**Root Cause:** All helper functions had `.includes()` check that prevented adding similar items:
```typescript
// Before (‚ùå Prevented duplicates)
if (newRequirement.trim() && !job.requirements.includes(newRequirement.trim())) {
  // add requirement
}
```

**Solution:** Removed duplicate checking from all array helper functions:
```typescript
// After (‚úÖ Allows any number of items)
if (newRequirement.trim()) {
  // add requirement without duplicate check
}
```

**Functions Fixed:**
- ‚úÖ `addRequirement()` - Now allows unlimited requirements
- ‚úÖ `addBenefit()` - Now allows unlimited benefits
- ‚úÖ `addSkill()` - Now allows unlimited skills
- ‚úÖ `addPerk()` - Now allows unlimited perks
- ‚úÖ `addResponsibility()` - Now allows unlimited responsibilities
- ‚úÖ `addLanguage()` - Now allows unlimited languages
- ‚úÖ `addImpactArea()` - Now allows unlimited impact areas
- ‚úÖ `addApplicationQuestion()` - Now allows unlimited questions

**Result:** Users can now add as many items as they need to each array field! üéâ

- Beautiful job header with organization info
- Detailed sections for description, requirements, benefits
- Compensation details
