## Files Modified/Created

### New Files:

2. `app/jobs/[id]/page-new.tsx` - Server component wrapper
3. `JOB_DETAIL_PREVIEW_REDESIGN.md` - This document

### Modified Files:
1. `app/ngos/post/page.tsx` - Complete preview redesign (lines 524-862)
2. `app/jobs/[id]/page.tsx` - Needs replacement with page-new.tsx

## What Needs to Be Done

### Immediate Actions:
1. **Replace page.tsx**:
   ```powershell
   Remove-Item "app/jobs/[id]/page.tsx"
   Rename-Item "app/jobs/[id]/page-new.tsx" "page.tsx"
   ```

2. **Test the pages**:
   - Post a new job with all fields filled
   - Click "Preview" - should show professional layout
   - Publish the job
   - View the job detail page - should match preview exactly
   - Test on mobile (responsive design)

3. **Verify all sections render**:
   - [ ] Hero with NGO avatar
   - [ ] Tabs work correctly
   - [ ] Responsibilities section
   - [ ] Impact & Reach section
   - [ ] Sidebar is sticky on desktop
   - [ ] All text wraps properly
