# üîß Issues Fixed - Complete Profile & Authentication

## ‚úÖ **Issue 1: Complete Profile API 400 Error** - FIXED

### Problem
```
POST /api/complete-profile 400 in 649ms
Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 400 (Bad Request)
```

### Root Cause
The complete-profile page was only sending `role` and `orgName`, but the API expected `role` and `plan`.

### Solution
1. **Updated `app/(auth)/complete-profile/page.tsx`**:
   - Added automatic plan selection based on role
   - NGO ‚Üí `ngo_base` (free plan)
   - Volunteer ‚Üí `volunteer_free` (free plan)
   - Now sends: `{ role, plan, orgName }`

2. **Updated `app/api/complete-profile/route.ts`**:
   - Added `orgName` to schema as optional field
   - Conditionally saves `orgName` for NGOs only
   - Added better error logging

### Test
1. Sign in with Google OAuth
2. Complete profile by selecting role
3. For NGO: enter organization name
4. Profile should complete successfully ‚úÖ
