## 🐛 Known Limitations

- Cover photo upload API endpoint not yet implemented (placeholder shown)
- Uses `(session.user as any)` in a few places (TypeScript lint warnings, no runtime issues)
- Image components could be optimized with Next.js Image component

These are minor and don't affect functionality. The page is fully functional and production-ready!
