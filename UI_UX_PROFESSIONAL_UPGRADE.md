# UI/UX Professional Upgrade - Complete

## Issues Fixed

### 1. âœ… Deleted User Can Still Login
**Problem**: User deleted from database could still access the website  
**Root Cause**: Session JWT callback didn't verify user existence  
**Solution**: Modified `auth.ts` to check if user exists in database during JWT refresh. If user not found, return `null` to force logout.

**File**: `auth.ts` (Line ~127-130)
```typescript
// If user no longer exists in database (deleted), invalidate token
if (!dbUser) {
  console.log("User not found in database, invalidating session:", token.email)
  return null as any // Force logout by returning null token
}
```

**Impact**: Deleted users are now automatically logged out on next request
